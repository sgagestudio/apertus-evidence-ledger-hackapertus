# Hack Apertus Submission Checklist

Track: **2B â€” Apertus Adoption: Own Project**  
Project: **Apertus Evidence Ledger**  
Deadline: **16 October 2026, 12:00 CEST**

The organizer states that the final submission is handled through the Hack Apertus website, not solely through the Devpost project page.

## Already complete

- [x] Owner joined Hack Apertus on Devpost.
- [x] Public repository created after the official hacking start.
- [x] Track 2B project concept implemented.
- [x] Real Apertus 1.5 local inference validated.
- [x] Deterministic local chunking + SQLite FTS5 retrieval.
- [x] SHA-256 evidence fingerprints.
- [x] Separate multilingual evidence-sufficiency gate.
- [x] Exact-quote / known-chunk citation verifier.
- [x] Explicit abstention flow.
- [x] Evidence ledger with evidence and model-output digests.
- [x] Local provenance-focused browser UI.
- [x] Current isolated real-model regression: 17/18; one supported Romansh output rejected for a non-exact source quote. Historical pre-isolation 18/18 retained but not used as the current headline.
- [x] Unchanged holdout: 12/12 on the current isolated evaluator.
- [x] Multi-evidence real-model set: 3/3.
- [x] 20/20 current software tests.
- [x] Document prompt-injection cases included.
- [x] Technical report committed.
- [x] Machine-readable evaluation result committed.
- [x] Code licensing: Apache-2.0.
- [x] Documentation/report licensing: CC-BY-4.0.
- [x] Evaluation data licensing: CDLA-Permissive-2.0.
- [x] Direct experiment spend remains EUR 0.

## Before final submission

- [x] Add and run a small multi-chunk set requiring multiple verified evidence facts.
- [ ] Re-run clean-clone unit tests.
- [ ] Re-run real Apertus evaluation and freeze the final result.
- [ ] Capture final browser screenshots using synthetic data only.
- [ ] Record the demo using `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` and keep it under the organizer's 2-minute maximum.
- [ ] Convert/finalize `technical_report.md` to `track_2b/TeamName_Report.pdf` (PDF, max 6 pages).
- [ ] Check the organizer submission form for any newly added fields.
- [ ] Verify public repository visibility and README from an unauthenticated view.
- [ ] Verify all submission links work.
- [ ] Confirm no secrets, private data, employer material, or personal documents are in the repository/video/report.
- [ ] Submit through the organizer's official submission page before the deadline.

## Final facts to use consistently

### Project name
Apertus Evidence Ledger

### Elevator pitch
A local-first, auditable AI assistant powered by Apertus that grounds answers in your documents, verifies every citation against the source, and keeps sensitive data under your control.

### Core judging story
- **Purposeful AI:** Apertus performs language reasoning and evidence-sufficiency judgment.
- **Technical rigour:** deterministic retrieval boundaries, exact-quote validation, regression/adversarial tests.
- **Value / cost / scalability:** lightweight SQLite FTS5, no required managed vector service, EUR 0 experiment spend.
- **Sovereign deployability:** documents, retrieval, verification and Apertus inference can remain local.
- **Implementation feasibility:** working CLI, web UI, tests, CI, real model validation.

## Claims not to make

Do not claim:
- that any small-suite result (historical 18/18, current 17/18, holdout 12/12, or multi-evidence 3/3) means Apertus has 100% general accuracy;
- that hashes prove document authorship or provide immutable non-repudiation;
- that the MVP supports production PDF provenance if that has not been implemented;
- that the local Q4 quantization is an official Hack Apertus-provided quantization;
- that a hosted public demo exists unless one is actually deployed.
